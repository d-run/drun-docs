### 3.2 Payment Methods

3.2.1 You may purchase our products and services online via the d.run platform webpage. Depending on the service nature, we provide a "prepaid charge" settlement method, meaning you need to pre-recharge funds at the "Cost Center" of the d.run platform before selecting a product or service. We will begin providing the product or service once your order is placed and payment is successfully processed. Specific billing rules follow the billing model and standards published on the relevant d.run platform page. To ensure timely service activation or continued provision, you should ensure your account balance is sufficient to cover the total cost of the services you need. You can check your account's purchase and usage records via the "Cost Center" function.

3.2.2 You acknowledge and agree that some products or services may have time or quantity restrictions, so you need to ensure that your account balance is sufficient to complete the payment after submitting an order. If there is insufficient balance or resource shortages or limits during the recharge or payment process, you will not be able to use the related products or services.

3.2.3 We recommend you recharge as needed. If you require a refund, you can contact us through the methods outlined in this agreement. We have the right to request you provide valid identity information and supporting documents for the refund review. Upon approval, we will refund the remaining unused balance after deducting handling fees and any costs you are responsible for. Unless otherwise agreed, unused voucher balances will not be refunded in cash under any circumstances.

### 3.3 Insufficient Balance or Arrears

3.3.1 If your account balance is insufficient or you have arrears, we have the right to suspend the service, and your account's vouchers will not be available for use. You should pay the outstanding balance within [15 days] of incurring the arrears to restore normal account usage. If you fail to settle the arrears after 15 days, to protect platform resources, we have the right to delete all your business data and log data within the maximum scope allowed by applicable law and terminate all or part of the services provided to you. We are not responsible for any service suspension, data deletion, or service termination caused by arrears.

3.3.2 If you have multiple accounts, each account will generally be billed independently. However, we reserve the right to combine the charges for all your accounts. For example, we have the right (but not the obligation) to use any unused prepaid balance in one of your accounts to offset arrears or other payable amounts for your other accounts.

3.3.3 You understand and agree that if any one of your accounts has insufficient balance or arrears, even though we may provide convenience to ensure that services for other accounts are unaffected, we reserve the right to take unified action across all accounts under the same username, such as suspending or terminating all account services or deleting user data.

## 5. Input/Generated Content

### 5.1 Responsibility for Inputs and Outputs

You are solely responsible for all input content submitted to the Service and the corresponding generated content. You must ensure that all business data uploaded, provided, stored, or processed while using the Service is legally owned or legally authorized by you, and that such data does not violate applicable laws or public order and good morals, does not breach any third-party contractual obligations, is free of ownership disputes, and does not infringe upon the lawful rights and interests of others, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, portrait rights, reputation rights, privacy rights, and trade secrets.

### 5.2 Risks of Generated Content

5.2.1 Due to the limitations of current scientific and technological capabilities and the nature of generative AI, we specifically remind you of the following risks and usage restrictions. You should use generative AI technologies rationally, scientifically, and lawfully, and bear the associated risks:

- The AI model does not truly understand input like a human does and cannot recognize potential risks or ethical issues, so we do not guarantee that generated content is true, complete, accurate, timely, reliable, lawful, non-infringing, or fit for any specific purpose;
- Although both input and generated content are subject to algorithmic screening, risks of infringement (especially when user input involves unauthorized materials or well-known IPs) cannot be completely avoided. Some content may contain flaws, be unreasonable, or cause discomfort. It is also possible that malicious prompt manipulation could result in outputs inconsistent with our views or that contain inappropriate or illegal content;
- Due to the working principles of AI, generated content may be identical, similar, or completely different across different or identical scenarios. Such content is for reference only and should not be relied upon as advice or a basis for decision-making. Particularly for medical, legal, financial, or other professional contexts, generated content does not constitute professional advice. Please consult relevant professionals before making decisions.

5.2.2 You are responsible for maintaining all generated content produced through your use of the Service. You should independently assess the risks of such content and bear full responsibility for your actions and their consequences, including but not limited to relying on the content’s truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, reliability, legality, or non-infringement. We accept no liability in this regard. If you publish or distribute generated content, you must verify its authenticity, accuracy, and legality, avoid disseminating false, illegal, or infringing information, and clearly label such content as AI-generated to inform the public.

5.2.3 If you have questions or concerns about generated content, or believe your legal rights (including intellectual property rights) have been infringed, you may contact us using the information provided in this Agreement. We will take your feedback seriously and respond with timely and effective measures.

5.3 We have the right, under applicable law, to review your inputs and generated content using technical means. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of any review results and make no other warranties regarding the review. Regardless of whether we review your content and the results of such review, this does not affect your obligations or liability. If we suffer any loss from processing your business data or generated content, you shall compensate us accordingly.

5.4 If we discover illegal or harmful content, we have the right to take actions such as halting generation or transmission, removing the content, implementing model optimization measures, and reporting to relevant authorities. If we discover that you are using our products or services for illegal activities, we may issue warnings, restrict functionality, suspend or terminate services, retain records, and report to authorities.

## 6. Data Processing and Personal Information Protection

To the extent permitted by applicable law, any texts, graphics, audio, video, technologies, software, systems, models, algorithms, programs, code, API lists, developer tools, data, and other materials generated or involved within the d.run platform and through this service are protected by intellectual property rights. Without the consent of the relevant rights holder, no organization or individual may use such materials for any commercial purpose. Any intellectual property achievements provided by one party to the other under this Agreement shall belong to the providing party or its lawful rights holder. The other party may only use them within the scope of the license expressly stated in this Agreement and shall not infringe the intellectual property rights and other lawful interests of the other party or its lawful rights holder in any manner. The intellectual property rights owned by you and us before the conclusion of this Agreement shall remain with their respective owners and shall not be transferred due to the execution, effectiveness, or performance of this Agreement.

8.2 We warrant that we have the legal rights and authorizations necessary to operate the d.run platform and provide this service. Except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, we do not grant users any other rights.

The d.run platform logo, the words “d.run,” “Daocloud,” and their combinations, as well as our domain names, URLs, service names, and other identifiers are owned by us and are protected by intellectual property laws. Without the rights holder’s permission, you may not display, use, or apply for trademarks, domain name registrations, etc., involving such identifiers, either individually or in combination, nor may you engage in any behavior that directly or indirectly implies you are authorized to do so or that infringes intellectual property rights.

8.4 You shall ensure that you legally own or have obtained authorization from the lawful rights holder to use your business data. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the intellectual property rights in the generated content legally obtained through proper procedures shall belong to you. Without your authorization, we will not use, modify, copy, publicly distribute, publish, or otherwise use your intellectual property beyond the scope of the license. If you use this service to train, optimize, debug, fine-tune AI models, or develop downstream AI applications or products, the ownership of the resulting intellectual property shall be determined according to this Agreement or the third-party model service provider's agreement. If no agreement exists, you may contact us for negotiation using the methods specified in this Agreement.
