## Definitions

- **Facial Information** : Refers to facial images, videos, and facial recognition data generated for identity authentication or recognition purposes.  
- **Authoritative Data Sources** : Government-authorized identity verification platforms established according to law, including but not limited to the Ministry of Public Security’s Citizen Network Identity Verification System.  
- **Authentication Service Provider** : Refers to Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd. and its affiliates, which provide the facial recognition technology used in this service.  

## Purpose of Processing

- **Real-Name Verification** : Verifies the consistency between the d.run account holder and the real-name subject using facial data comparison.  
- **Account Security** : Uses facial recognition technology for identity verification to ensure secure account operations.  

## Processing Methods

- **Information Collection** : The device camera is used in real-time to collect facial images/videos. This data is used solely for one-time authentication.  
- **Technical Implementation** : Alipay's financial-grade facial recognition technology compares the collected data in real time with authoritative sources (comparison completed within 30 seconds). We do not store any original facial images, videos, or biometric templates.  
- **Third-Party Processing** : Facial data generated during authentication is processed by Alipay in accordance with the [Alipay Face Recognition Authentication Service Agreement](https://render.alipay.com/p/f/fd-j8mezje2/index.html). We only receive the result (pass/fail).  

## Data Management

- **Transmission Security** : End-to-end encrypted transmission using SSL/TLS 1.2 or above, compliant with GM/T 0024-2014 cryptographic standards.  
- **Data Retention** : Unless otherwise required by law, we do not store original facial images, videos, or biometric data—only encrypted authentication results with timestamps are retained.
