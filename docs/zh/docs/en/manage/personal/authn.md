## Personal Verification

Designed for individual users, this process is fast and efficient, typically completed automatically within a few minutes.

Steps for verification:

1. **Scan QR Code via Alipay**  
   Use Alipay to scan the verification QR code and bind your real-name information.

2. **Upload and Verify ID Information**  
   Submit a valid and authentic ID. The system will automatically verify the consistency between the name and ID number.

3. **Facial Recognition Verification**  
   Complete facial recognition using Alipay. The system will automatically compare and review the results.  

    > Please ensure proper lighting and keep your face unobstructed to improve recognition accuracy.

Once the above steps are completed, the system will automatically finalize the verification without manual intervention.
