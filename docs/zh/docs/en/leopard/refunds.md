# Refund Policy (Trial)

We provide a flexible refund mechanism to ensure users’ rights are protected under reasonable circumstances.  
Based on different product types and billing modes, the d.run platform has established corresponding refund policies to ensure fair and reasonable expense handling when users change requirements or terminate services.

## Refunds to Wallet Balance

By default, automatic refunds are credited back to the account wallet balance. The refunded balance can be used for future consumption.

### Pay-as-you-go

**Container Instances (Pay-as-you-go)**
