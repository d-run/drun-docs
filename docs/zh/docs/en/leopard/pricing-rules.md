# Billing Rules

Welcome to the d.run Cloud Service Platform! To help you better understand and manage your expenses, we have prepared this billing rules document.  
This document explains in detail the billing mechanisms, pricing standards of each product, and related expense management policies to help you plan and control costs effectively.

## Billing System Overview

The platform adopts an enterprise-grade multi-layer billing architecture, consisting of the application layer, billing engine layer, and data layer, ensuring the billing process is accurate, fair, and transparent.

**System Features:**

- **Professional Billing Engine**: Independent billing processing layer to ensure professionalism and high reliability of financial transactions  
- **Robust Data Management**: Dedicated data layer to manage account balances, orders, bills, and usage information  
- **Full Audit Tracking**: Detailed data records support expense queries and audits, improving financial transparency  

## Billing Principles and Service Commitments

### Accurate Billing Commitment

**Per-second billing with hourly settlement**

- Billing is calculated per second, ensuring you only pay for actual resource usage  
- Fees are settled at the top of the hour, maximizing your benefits  

**Smart Trigger Mechanism**

- Node trigger: Billing automatically starts when a resource is created or launched  
- Event trigger: Billing precisely stops or adjusts when a resource is shut down, deleted, or reconfigured  
- Prevents duplicate charges for idle or deleted resources  

### Service Guarantee Mechanism

**Fault Tolerance**

- Abnormal orders caused by system failures are automatically voided, ensuring you wonâ€™t be charged incorrectly  
- Comprehensive handling processes protect your rights in case of exceptions  

**Real-time Monitoring**

- 24/7 real-time monitoring of resource status ensures billing accuracy  
- Supports differentiated billing strategies for different products  

**User-friendly Policies**

- A grace period is provided when the balance is insufficient, preventing sudden service interruption  
- Flexible refund mechanisms safeguard your legitimate rights
